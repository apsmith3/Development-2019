About Application:
This Application is a memory game designed to make use of six Philips hue 
lights as set up in SMB109. This application will flash the lights in a randomly 
generated sequence and then prompt the user to input the same sequence back into the site 
and determine whether they recalled the sequence correctly or not.

It has four difficulty options easy, medium, hard, endless, to be selected by the user.

Each light is assigned its own colour to remain consistent during the game.

These lights flash in a randomly generated order starting with just one flash then waiting for the user to indicate which of the lights using input buttons on the application page laid out and colour to represent each of the lights.

The application will then randomly add another light to the sequence of flashes and again wait for the user to input the corresponding sequence in the correct order.

This will repeat until the sequence length required to complete the game has been reached based on the difficulty previously chosen.

If the user incorrectly inputs the pattern the lights will flash red along with an alert indicating that they were incorrect, and the game will stop.

If the user correctly reaches the end of the game, all the lights will flash green and an alert will pop up indicating success.
